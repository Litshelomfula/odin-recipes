    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This is an adaptation of the official lasagne from the Bolognese Chambers of <br/>Commerce. I have made a couple of changes suggested to me by the people <br/> from the area such as, which meat or wine to use or if there should be milk added or <br/> not.One thing never in question,though, is the green lasagne sheets. These are<br/> a must. The ragu is an authentic sauce, simple without garlic or herbs and <br/> spices.Using fresh pasta keeps you from having to pre-boil it.</p>
